# CiCIDS2017n2018MLSTUDY
In this repo data preparation and feature selection for CIC IDS 2017 and 2018 were done with the following comparison of multiple sampling and scaling methods and then parameters search with Optuna. In the end final models (RandomForest and LightGBM) were tested on cross-dataset validation which showed major overfitting issues that weren't that noticeable in the single dataset validation of models. The idea for this cross-dataset validation was taken from "Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms in Network-Based Intrusion Detection Using Progressive Dataset" study done by Tuan-Hong Chua and Iftekhar Salam.

Everything in this repository is part of the Masters thesis in ITMO University Information Security program.

Im not a data science specialist or Machine Learning Engineer.

Feel free to use as you please.

I don't plan on cleaning and refactoring this repository - sorry!
